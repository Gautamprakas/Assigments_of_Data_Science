    "regression tasks. It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying \n",
    "distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The KNN algorithm works by finding the K closest data points to a given test data point and then making a prediction \n",
    "based on the class or value of those nearest neighbors. The distance between the test data point and its nearest neighbors \n",
    "is typically measured using Euclidean distance or other distance metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification tasks, the KNN algorithm assigns the class label that is most common among its K nearest neighbors. \n",
    "For example, if K=3 and the three nearest neighbors are labeled as \"cat\", \"dog\", and \"cat\", then the algorithm would classify \n",
    "the test data point as \"cat\".\n",

    "The choice of K is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to improve the performance of the algorithm. A smaller value of K makes\n",

    "'''Q2. How do you choose the value of K in KNN?\n",
    "Answer-The value of K in the KNN algorithm is a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen carefully to achieve good performance. \n",
    "Choosing the right value of K depends on the characteristics of the data and the specific problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common approaches to choose the value of K in KNN:\n",

    "Cross-validation: One common approach is to use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm for \n",
    "different values of K. The value of K that gives the best performance on the validation set can then be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule of thumb: A simple rule of thumb is to set K to the square root of the number of data points in the training set. \n",
    "However, this rule may not always be optimal and should be used as a starting point for further experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem-specific knowledge: The value of K may also depend on the specific problem and domain knowledge. For example,\n",
    "in image classification tasks, K=1 (i.e., nearest neighbor) may be more appropriate as each image may have unique features \n",
    "that distinguish it from others.\n",

    "Grid search: Another approach is to perform a grid search over a range of values of K and evaluate the performance of the KNN \n",
    "algorithm for each value of K. The value of K that gives the best performance can then be chosen.\n",
